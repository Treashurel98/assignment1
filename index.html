      <p> New York City has withstood a lot over the past year. Besides the everstanding pandemic, the newest battle for us to overcome seems to be hurricanes. Hurricane Ida flooded many people's homes, particularly their basements. This left many who rented basement apartments in a house either without a home, without their belongings, or, unfortunately, without their life. Laurel Marie, a longtime homeowner on 171st Street in Jamaica, Queens, is one of many residents whose homes flooded last month when Hurricane Ida released violent rain in the New York area. Though her basement did not receive extreme damage, the experience made her realize the importance of flood insurance.
“ I have lived here since the 90s, and have never had flood insurance. Ida has opened my eyes,” said Marie.

    FEMA's New Flood Insurance Policy: Risk Rating 2.0  </a>
      </p>

      <p> In response to the increase in flooding, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has decided to replace their old policy, "Preferred Risk Policy", with a new policy, " Risk Rating 2.0". Their old policy, "Preferred Risk Policy", used a separate technique for coming up with premiums for homes outside of the coastal floodplain.

          <p> Risk Rating 2.0 is supposedly designed to better distribute premiums to all policyholders based on their home value and a single property’s specific flood risk. While it is still unclear just how costly Risk Rating 2.0 will be for families outside of high-risk flood areas, it is presumed that there will be an increase in rates. Families who live in low-income homes which might now be considered high-risk flood areas because of damages will have to await the verdict.  </p>

            <p> Homes that are currently outside of the high-risk flood area, might be added to that category given the introduction of Risk Rating 2.0. This will force some families living in lower-valued homes to purchase flood insurance, which will most likely be a sky high rates.
